/**
 * GET /api/company/check-org-number?org_number=XXXXXXXXXX
 *
 * Returns `{ data: { exists, companies, exists_elsewhere } }`:
 * - `exists` / `companies`: matches among the CURRENT USER's own companies
 *   (`{ id, name }[]`), scoped by RLS.
 * - `exists_elsewhere`: true when a non-archived company with this org number
 *   exists in an account the caller is NOT a member of. Existence only: no
 *   id, name, or owner ever leaves the server. This is what lets the wizard
 *   hint "this company already exists in Accounted" before a user rebuilds
 *   their bookkeeping in a second account and strands the first (#1231).
 *
 * Org-number reuse across the platform is intentionally allowed (see
 * lib/company/actions.ts), so both signals are soft warnings, NOT a
 * uniqueness gate. The own-companies query uses the authenticated client on
 * purpose: the `companies` SELECT RLS policy limits results to companies the
 * caller is a member of (id IN user_company_ids()). The cross-account probe
 * uses the service client but deliberately reduces to one boolean.
 *
 * Normalizes input with the same rule as the create action so a 12-digit form
 * still matches a stored 10-digit canonical. Returns no matches for malformed
 * input: the create action rejects that separately as `org_number_invalid`.
