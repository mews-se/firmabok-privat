-- Role-gated write authorization + tenant guards on voucher SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
--
-- WHY THIS MIGRATION EXISTS
-- -------------------------
-- The staging/dev database has carried, for some time, an authorization
-- refactor that was never captured as a migration and therefore never reached
-- production:
--
--   * public.current_active_company_id()  — the single active company for the
--     caller (user_preferences.active_company_id, validated against a live,
--     non-archived membership; falls back to the earliest membership).
--   * public.current_user_can_write()     — true iff the caller is a non-viewer
--     member of that active company.
--   * Every company-scoped WRITE policy AND-s in current_user_can_write() and
--     scopes the company to current_active_company_id(), so a `viewer` (or any
--     non-member) cannot INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE tenant data by calling PostgREST
--     directly — the app-layer requireWritePermission() guard is no longer the
--     only thing standing between a viewer and a write.
--
-- lib/supabase/middleware.ts and lib/auth/require-write.ts already document and
-- rely on these functions; the application is written for this design. On
-- production the write policies still gate on membership only
-- (company_id IN (SELECT user_company_ids())), so a viewer CAN currently write
-- via the API. This migration makes the repository the source of truth and,
-- when deployed, brings production in line with staging.
--
-- It ALSO hardens three voucher SECURITY DEFINER RPCs that were EXECUTE-able by
-- anon/authenticated with NO caller-membership check (a cross-tenant hole: any
-- authenticated caller who knows a draft UUID could POST
-- /rest/v1/rpc/commit_journal_entry with a foreign company_id and post that
-- tenant's draft). The guard is the canonical one from
-- 20260619130100_securitydefiner_write_rpc_tenant_guards.sql: it reads the
-- request.jwt.claims role and only constrains anon/authenticated callers.
-- service_role / backend callers (no JWT role — the engine's service-role
-- commit path, the MCP/API-key path whose company scoping happens in TS, the
-- pg-real harness, migrations) bypass BY DESIGN, so those flows are unaffected.
--
-- Everything below is idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE / DROP POLICY IF EXISTS),
-- so it is a no-op against staging (which already has the policies) and a
-- corrective apply against production.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.current_active_company_id()
  RETURNS uuid
  LANGUAGE sql
  STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path TO 'public'

-- =============================================================================
-- 2. Role-gated write policies (38 tables)
--    DDL generated verbatim from the live staging catalog (pg_policies) so the
--    predicates match exactly what the app has been running against.
-- =============================================================================

-- NOTE: the staging catalog also carried an ai_usage_tracking_insert policy,
-- but public.ai_usage_tracking was dropped by
-- 20260504120000_remove_ai_subsystem.sql and no longer exists in the canonical
-- schema — the table on staging is drift. That policy is intentionally NOT
-- recreated here; a from-scratch migration chain would fail on it.

-- automation_webhooks was renamed to public.webhooks by
-- 20260515170000_webhooks_v2 — the staging catalog still carried the
-- pre-rename table name (drift). Gate the canonical table, dropping both the
-- staging-era policy names and the legacy schema-sync names defensively
-- (policies follow a table rename but keep their original names).
