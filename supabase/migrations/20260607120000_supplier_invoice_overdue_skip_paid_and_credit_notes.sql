-- Migration: supplier_invoice_overdue_skip_paid_and_credit_notes
--
-- Fix: supplier invoices showing "Förfallen" (overdue) even though
-- "kvar att betala" (remaining_amount) is 0 kr.
--
-- Root cause: update_overdue_supplier_invoices() (the daily cron job from
-- 20260303145744_supplier_invoice_overdue_cron.sql) flipped EVERY row past its
-- due_date whose status was 'registered'/'approved' to 'overdue', without ever
-- looking at the outstanding balance.
--
-- Credit notes (is_credit_note = true) are created with status='registered',
-- remaining_amount=0 and due_date=today (see the supplier-invoice credit
-- routes). A credit note is not a payable — there is nothing to pay and nothing
-- to fall due — but because it sits in 'registered' with a due_date of today,
-- the cron turned it 'overdue' the very next day. The same happens to any
-- regular invoice that was fully paid but left in 'registered'/'approved'.
--
-- Two parts:
--   1. Guard the cron so a row with no outstanding balance, or a credit note,
--      is never marked overdue.
--   2. Backfill the rows already mis-flagged.

-- 1. Guarded cron function ---------------------------------------------------
-- CREATE OR REPLACE rewrites the whole definition, so re-declare the
-- search_path that 20260304191528_set_search_path_on_functions.sql pinned.
